#### Organization: Sympy
#### Title: Improve Polynomial GCD
#### Proposal link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xlf72ABH68kb3BT8MISgH9MNIUej-lGo/view
#### Abstract: 
The project aims to add new algorithms for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD)
of polynomials in the sparse representation in order to improve the speed of many parts
of sympy such as matrices, solvers, integration, and simplification functions. Currently, 
the slow speed of polynomial GCD impacts many operations in SymPy, leading to the heavy 
performance penalties and avoiding the use of domain elements in some of the algorithms. 
By improving the speed of polynomial GCD algorithms, many parts of SymPy could become
faster, and the use of GCD could become more widespread. This project could significantly
enhance the overall performance and usability of SymPy.
